        <p>
          Haifa is Israel’s third largest city. It sits on the slopes of Mount
          Carmel facing the Mediterranean Sea. Some call it "Israel’s San
          Francisco".

          <p>
            The city is situated on the northern slopes of Mount Carmel, except
            for the port section on the bay; residential and business districts
            are on the slopes, and finer residences and many resort hotels on
            the mountaintop, commanding scenic views of the entire bay area. The
            lower and upper cities are linked by an underground railway.
