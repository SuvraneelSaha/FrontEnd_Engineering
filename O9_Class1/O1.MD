Agenda of today's session : WEB

Most Important thing in the web is Browser 

Very Very important 

what differentiates you as an engineer that only makes you a better engineer

How Browser render websites ? 

99% ans - Browsers converts html into a dom object and renders the webpage 

Ans in an indepth way to differentiate yourself 

correct ans - It is a simple software that can load some files from your computer hdd or sdd or it can load some files from a remote server . 
what is the meaning of remote server ? 
remote in cs : something that is present somewhere else  , not present immediately with you . 

Remote Server : present somewhere else 

then Browser figures out how to display your content 

- it was a simple text file - index.txt 

- if html then it will take other strategy to display the file 

- How Browser compute how to display any file ? 

--> Browsers have an engine that decides algorithmically how to display your content 

Browsers can load a lot of files 
Browser cannot load .exe files 

it depends on the browser 

we can open video files in browsers , json , pdf files , text files 

What is an engine in case of browser ? 

You dont tell the car how to drive , you drive the car . 
the internal engine automatically decides what to do - accelerates , 
hand brake , - its all dependent on the browser's engine 

Browser engine has a set of instructions 
it is a simple software what to display by algorithmically 

You dont want to rebuild every wheel 

The lag is due to network issue 
the video lag comes later 
the audio is given priority 

Focus on the thing 
we are the engineers - concentrate on the content 

Ex - gecko browser engine - its used in firefox browser 

search - browser engine gecko 

ex - Blink browser engine - chromium browser is used 

ex - Webkit engine 

ex -chrome  V8  engine - it is responsible for rendering js 
browser engine is different from js engine

Browser engine : Browser (the main part )

designing compilers is a separate thing all together 
We know compilers but we dont know about the compilation

How Browsers loads the files ? html css and js files 

when we actually load the html file 

ex -- of tokenizer : 

x = (3>2) ? 5 : 2 ; 

3 components in a ternary operator 

ans of x = 5 

The compiler reads this code cryptic code 
for  a compiler it is a cryptic code 
compiler is a dumb piece of software 

it has a mechanism of breaking it down into small small components 

// "x" "=" "(3>2) ? 5 : 2 " "; "

the breaking down of components into tokens is done by the compiler 
its done by parse tree 

the browser will break the code into parse tree and will make sense and display for the tags 

Compiler Design is pretty technical concepts 

Theory of Automata 

2.
after tokenization - node objects are created --> Representation of the nodes in form of a tree --> Dom Tree 


dom is not the last step 
what about the css 


html - hyper text 
documents linked to the html file 

html skeleton 
css - styling 
js - brain 

css bytes --> character --> tokenization --> Nodes --> CSSOM

DOM + CSSOm == Render Tree 

if it will happen will not not happen - if for knowledge search the net 


engineering design - lol moment in college 
drafters and all the story 

render tree --> reflow step --> painting happens 

Script tag after body tag ? 

as dom construction stops due to the js 
js halts everything 

HTML 

head --> script 

Body


then script first then html and css object models 


Script can interact with CSS Also 


Clubbing happens when both the html dom and cssom combines

English is the preferred .
