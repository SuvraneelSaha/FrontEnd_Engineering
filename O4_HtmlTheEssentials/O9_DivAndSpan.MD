what is a Block element 

A block element is an element in which the content inside of the element starts from a new line 

ex - 
<div>
hi there 
</div>

<div>
hi there 
div 2 
</div>

these two will be shown on separate lines 
so it is a block level element

What is an Inline Element ? 

An inline element is an element in which the content is presented or portrayed in the same line only 

Ex - 

<span>
span 1 
</span>

and 

<span>
span 2
</span>

will be shown on a single line only
