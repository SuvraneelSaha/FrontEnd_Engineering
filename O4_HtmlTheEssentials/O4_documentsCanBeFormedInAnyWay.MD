 ## Documents can be formed in any way possible
~~~
Say for example in google docs can we write a 
text with font 11 px before the text with font of 22 px 
yes we can 

then in html also we can 

there's no rule mandatory then we cannot write the documents as per our wish 

its upto us how we will use it 

otherwise theres a convention that needs to be followed 
but there arent any hard and fast rules
