## Lists in html 

~~~
Lists in html are just same as that in case of google docs 
~~~

~~~
There are 2 types of lists 
one is Ordered list
and another one is Unordered List 
~~~

~~~
In case of Ordered List 

there is sequential way of lists 

and In case of Unordered List 

there is non sequential way of writing lists 
~~~

~~~
Syntax of Ordered List : 
<ol>
</ol>
~~~

~~~
Syntax of Unordered List : 

<ul>
</ul>
~~~

~~~
The common item is li 

which represents the list item 

it is present inside both of ol and ul 
~~~

~~~
We can also create sublists inside of ol and in ul 

We can change the shape the bullets or numbering using html properties or by using CSS
