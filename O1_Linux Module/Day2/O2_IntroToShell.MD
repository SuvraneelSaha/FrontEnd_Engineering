### Intro to Shell 

### The relation between the shell commands and Shell Scripting 

~~~
just like inp python or in java we use syntaxes

here just in the command line we use shell commands like ls cd pwd 

these are all shell commands and when combined it will be like a Scripting ie 
programming 
~~~

### why shell Scripting is needed 
~~~
Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment.
~~~

### What are Shells 

~~~
A shell is a program that acts as an interface between a user and the kernel. It allows a user to give commands to the kernel and receive responses from it. Through a shell, we can execute programs and utilities on the kernel. Hence, at its core, a shell is a program used to execute other programs on our system.

### What is REPL and does Shell or Terminal follows it ? 

~~~
R - READ 
E- Evaluate 
P - Print 
L - Loop 
~~~

~~~
all the consoles like terminal all of these are technically repl consoles 

it reads a valid command from the user 
then it will evaluate the command what it is capable to do 
then it will print the result of the command

then it will loop again 

its just like an infinite console . 

Example - Terminal , python console . 

~~~

### What is a terminal 

~~~
It is a console or an emulator where we can write and execute valid shell script commands.

Just like a python console we can use the python commands to execute a program 
~~~

### What are the different types of shell environments

~~~
example- bash , terminal , cmd , powershell
~~~

### You dont need to remember all the commands you just need to remember ony the command to remember that 

~~~
For any linux command you can actually check the usage and the input flags it expects by running the command followed by --help
