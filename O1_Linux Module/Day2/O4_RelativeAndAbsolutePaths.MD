### Relative and Absolute Paths 

### Home dir : 

~~~
cd ~ gives the home directory . 
the home directory is a subfolder inside of the root dir 

~ --> this tilda refers to the home dir 
Example : /home/uvro

~~~

### Root dir: 

~~~
the root dir is the one dir where it has no parent 
which means it is the parent of all dirs and sub dirs 

root directory is represented by / only forward slash 

whereas in case of home it is represented by ~ 
~~~

### Relative Path 

~~~
cd Desktop/
then 
cd folder/

this is the relative path 
as the folder is relative to that of the dir Desktop 
the folder is related to that of its parent dir Desktop 
and we are navigating inside of it so it is relative in nature


~~~

### Absolute vs Relative paths 
~~~
The whole folder structure is tree based structure 
Relative path : it describes the location of a file/folder wrt current folder 

whereas in case of absolute path 

we mention the location from the home dir or the root dir 

when you give absolute path of a file/folder you will give the whole path of the file/ folder 
but in case of relative paths you do jump wrt the current folder
