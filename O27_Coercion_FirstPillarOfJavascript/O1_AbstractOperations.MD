## Points 

### Abstract Operations 


1. 
~~~
there are some set of algos that is present in the ecmascript docs that they are not available in the ecmascript . 

ie we as devs cannot use these operations directly 
~~~

2. 
~~~
They are mentioned in the docs to aid (help) the documentation process only 

in the ecma does there are a lot of things that are dont by the language internally , to explain these internal details of how and what the language is doing , we have abstract operations . 

~~~

#### Analogy 

~~~
Abstract operations are there to help us indirectly , we cannot use the functionalities of these abstract operations directly , but it is there to help us understand why the js language is doing what it is doing .. 


Example -- 

we go to the bank to deposit money , we dont know how the cashier works behind the counter , we just know that when we give our money , the cashier takes our money and gives us a slip prompting that our money has been deposited . We can use this feature of cash deposit but we dont know how it is doing behind the scenes . So this is an Abstract Operation .
