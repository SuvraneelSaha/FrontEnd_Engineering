## Introduction to Coercion :

~~~
WE will understand how the input conversion works and when the automatic type conversion takes place 


We will understand when these operations will take place and in depth we will learn so that 
we give valid reasons why this is happening in js . 
1+1 = 2 

"1" + 1 = 11 

"1" - 1 = 0 

There is no magic no automatic no weirdness in js , its just we dont spend time with JS 

When we will be spending time with Js , we will get to know and will love JS 

I love JS .
