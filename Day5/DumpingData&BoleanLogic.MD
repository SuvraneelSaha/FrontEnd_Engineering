## Dumping data and Boolean Logic 

~~~
How to dump data inside of a file 
use command 
Example - ls > dump.txt
> is the dump command 
~~~

~~~
What happens is that when we use > command it replaces whatever that is present inside of the dump.txt file 
and will replace with the new dumping 

and if we want to append it that is to add it to the file at the end 
then we can use 
>>
Example : 
ls >> dump.txt 

~~~

~~~
Boolean Logic & 

by using the & it acts as an And Operator 
it combines two commands 
and if any one of the commands fails then the other command will not be executed 

to execute the command both the command needs to be true ie run 

Example : 
javac O1.java && java O1.java
