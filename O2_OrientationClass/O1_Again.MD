### Orientation Class 

~~~
In the beginning sanket was not able to undestand anything 
40-50  hours nothing 

he just wrote whatever the author wrote it 
2 times whatever the author wrote and there no looking back 

do your assignments 

every question is solvable by chat gpt 

you have to be diligent to understand and learn web dev or any other thing 

2 new things 

learning through incentive 
and milestone incentive 

Best thing for learning - teach other people students or people 
1 thing is that in the middle our enthu drops a lot 
class 11 example 

so give yourself incentives from your own 

Post it on twitter and linkedin 

incentive you will get and you will give it to yourself 

then and then only we can grow and level up 

Learning in Public :

that will boost you to study 
to learn you have an incentive in your mind that you have to do it . 
You are scared still you will do it . 
Even Mike tyson was scared still he did it 


How to ask doubts : 
Have a framework - ask doubts in such a way that you are working in a company 
ex - you work in Microsoft then you can ask doubts 
but multiple times they wont help 

they will ask did you gave any efforts 

99% of the doubts can be solved with googling 

Debug a similar error or issue then you will be able to solve more and more errors 

Maintain a constant repo in github 

How to share your doubt or code : 

First make sure you googled and tried to solve your error and if nothing comes to work then and then only ask 
99% of the problems can be solved by googling So make sure you search in the google before asking your doubt 

1. tell the approach how you tried to solve the problem 
2. share the code snippet in a github repo 
3. point out where the problem lies
4. There is high chances someone has faced the same error or issues 

All the people have their day 1 its not that they are not human 
they all have gone through challenges also so dont think that they know everything from the back of their mind 

You must experience hardship and struggle 
and when you are having doubt solving session - take notes on that doubt 

You must learn the art of googling and you must be self dependent you 
cannot be dependent on someone on your colleagues or  anybody 
it will reflect on your personality or feedback 

if they are doing an additional help they are doing it on being a altruistic person 
but they may not also help so you need to keep your ass afloat 

Working in silos gets you promoted 
self independent nigga is the main goal 

Live Lecture - front end concepts , projects or Interview questions solving 

Focus on the Assignment not on the Lectures 
Dont bang your head on the lectures 
Spend more time in Assignments 

The more code debugging you do the more competent you become in debugging 

The more code you read the more better developer you become 

40 % debugging 
30 % reading docs 
30% Code 

Ask Good Questions 

People want to help but not spoonfeed 

Building Community is the side effect of Learning in Public 

also referrals guidance on projects connections 

Social media can be a career

In tech Social media is a biggest advantage you can get - helps referrals 

Open source contribution

Hiring is there if you have high competence 

1st priority : Make it work , Make the project work 
then make it optimized 

DSA is Important 
3 things are cheatcodes here 
1. DSA 
2. Development 
3. Open Source

Discipline and the desire to improve will only save you
