and 
another way is to learn by the hardest way

short story : 
he took a backed course 
HE just wrote whatever the author has written from the github 
he wrote it twice , then 
there's no way looking behind 
He understood all the logic by finding out about syntaxes , searching for the concepts and all

2 New things 

Learning through incentive : 
Enthusiasm drops 
Ex - class 11 drops at the middle 

Give incentive from you to yourself 

in the course 
consume the content - do the challenges - tweet - do assignment - 
Learning in Public 
Picking one for the gift and they will give 

they will check the watch time , how much engagement you are having . 

document the journey and also post it in a blog 

Every time you sit to study there's an gift to earn

How to ask doubts : 
you have to ask doubts in a professional manner as if you are working in the company 

Not everytime you can bug others 
ex - where is the file located 

did you searched for it , did you give any efforts 

90 % of the doubts will be solved 

read the error and solve it 

solve your own doubts 

Try to debug and see similar code examples 
stackoverflow or any other yours previous code examples 

post that if you cant find : then 
ask doubts with proper descripting of error and code example 

photos --> then the process of solving --> what you did --> the code 
share (github code)

send the link of the repo 


Use the internet - its god send 
search the internet thats it 
99% of the problems will be resolved 

we all have experienced the hardships 
we all have gone through hard times 

when somebody is helping me - I take notes 

the smaller the company - the more self dependent you have to be 
unblock yourself 

it reflects on yourself 

you have to be self dependent on yourself , you cannot ask for 
doubts for mere challenges 

Working in silos , you will be promoted you will grow

only doing the projects and assignment will only help 
watching tutorials and videos will not help you in the long run . 
15. Hiring is always there you just need to be a good developer 
focus on the skills
