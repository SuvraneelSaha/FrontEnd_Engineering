# Learning Markdowns 

## We will be learning the basics of Markdown Mainly - 

```
Headings , Paragraphs , Lists Both Ordered and Unordered , Blockquotes , Links , Images 
```

### Headings 

~~~
Just Like HTML h1- h6 here we use # for the Number of the Heading from 1 to 6
~~~

### Paragraphs

~~~
Paragraphs are simple , just text 
and if you want to end a paragraph just add a new line after the desired text 
it will create a new paragraph 
~~~

### Lists

~~~
 Lists are present in markdown like both the ordered and the unordered 

 for Unordered 
 use:
 * Item-name
 * Item-Name 
~~~

Example 

* Item_One
* Item_Two

~~~
Ordered List
just write
1.
2.
3.
or even if we dont maintain the number then also its fine 
Example : 
1.
1.
1.
~~~

Example

1. A
1. B
3. C
6. D

### BlockQuotes

~~~
BlockQuotes are quotes 
how can you give a text quote 

use > 
~~~

Example 

>"The sin of doing nothing is the deadliest of all the seven sins. It has been said that for evil men to accomplish their purpose it is only necessary that good men should do nothing."

### Bold

~~~
To make any text bold or words or a paragraphs 
use **Bold**
~~~

Example

Make this **Word** Bold bu using double asterisk symbol

### italic

~~~
Make any text italic by using underscores 
Example -

_italic words_ 
~~~

Example 

_italic words_

### Links 

~~~
Links can be added in two different ways one is Inline 
Example 

[alt text](Link url)
~~~

Example

[Search for it ](https://www.google.com/)

~~~
Another way links can be written is by reference link
Example 
 Here's [a link to something else][another place].
     Here's [yet another link][another-link].
     And now back to [the first link][another place].

     [another place]: www.github.com
     [another-link]: www.google.com
~~~

Example 

Do you want to [see something fun][a fun place]?

Well, do I have [the website for you][another fun place]!

[a fun place]:www.zombo.com

[another fun place]: www.stumbleupon.com

### Images 

~~~
Images are just like links but we need to use an Exclamation mark befor it 

Just like this :
