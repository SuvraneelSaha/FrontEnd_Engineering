## Descendant , child , adjacent and general sibling combinator 

~~~
div span 
{
  color:carrotblue;
}

the child of a div is the only will be changed ie here span


break tag - move to a new line 

div .extra{
  text-decoration:underline;
}

anything in the subtree will be given the property 

div > span{

}
this should be immediate children or child 
> -- immediate child 

Genral sibling Combinator : 

h2 ~ h4{
  color:chocolate;
}

h4 is the sibling h2 and that why it got the property 

same parent in this case 

h2 + h4{
color : black
}
h4 is not immediate sibling of h2 

but div + h4{
  h4 is the immediate sibling of div 
}
