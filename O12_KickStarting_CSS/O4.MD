css stands for cascading style sheets 

what is the meaning of cascading ? 

The “cascading” in CSS refers to the fact that styling rules “cascade” down from several sources. This means that CSS has an inherent hierarchy and styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.

in layman terms its a basically an algorithm which is used for styling on how the elements will be styled if many styling 
properties will be given ; which will be given precedence and which will not be given precedence .
