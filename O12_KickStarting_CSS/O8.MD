## Why internal and inline css is bad 

~~~
internal css cons : 
cant be copied and linked with multiple html files 

the concept of separation of concerns comes into play 

bloats the html document 

can be used for small and simple webpages 
~~~

~~~
Inline CSS Cons :

cant be applied to many elements at the same time ie grouping is not possible 

Precedence of the inline css is always higher than internal and external css

Bloats the html document 

cannot be used for big websites
