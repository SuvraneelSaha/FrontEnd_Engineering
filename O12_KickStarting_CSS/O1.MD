## How CSS is expected to be done by an Engineer 

~~~
so the thing about css is that css is vast thing just like anything else 
you cant master it in 1 day nor in 1 week nor in 1 month but down the line if you spend enough time , you will 
become a master in it .

Why not to think about web design an aesthetically looking websites?
  Cause whenever you join a company or a startup there will be a designer 
  who will give you a finished design and your only work is to mimic it , 
  make it look exactly the same , where the execution is important rather than the thinking . 

  You will appreciate the design part but also you dont have to worry about the design the color schemes and what not 

  When replicating the design you will need lots and lots of googling and that will only help you . 
  No engineer senior junior or intern or pro knows everything from the back of the mind. 
  They just know how to get things done , and for yourself to become a great developer , you also need to 
  learn the art of googling , cause 99% of the problems can be solved just by googling . 

  Dont focus on why this design or why this is happening , focus on how can i get things done . 
  and over the period of time , you will know the reasons also . 
  Give it time . Time helps you Develop .
