## Pseudo Classes and Pseudo Elements 

~~~
Hovering or change of state 

ie state information 

a:hover{
text-decoration : none;
}

its a state based info its not a part of dom 

a:visited{
  color:black
}

target = blank 
new tab opening 
in html 

pseudo classes : its a state 

Pseudo Elements -- 

pseudo means its not real 
by the help of Pseudo Elements we can add elements in the html without even changing the html document 

div :firs-child{
  font-size:10px;
}

space should be given after div ie parent here

what the mistake we were doing it was 
div:first-child{

}
if div is the first child of his parent then select the style 


:nth child
ex - li:nth-child(-n+3)
{

}

n being 0 1 2
