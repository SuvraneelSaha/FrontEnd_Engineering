~~~
 building block of whatever you do in bootstrap 
 container class
~~~

~~~
col shrinks equal to the content - col-auto class
~~~

~~~
justify-content-space-between
space has been slightly pushed on both the sides so that 
it does not take extra space on  the other end 
~~~

~~~
Why we put the whole content ie the 5 rows and in the first 4 rows 4 cols inside the 
col div and then inside of the row class --> Cause then all the 4 rows will be inside of a column 
and it everything will be inside of a single column 

if we want for out content to take col space 
~~~

~~~
col-auto --> takes width equal to that of the content 
~~~

~~~
col --> takes the whole width of the parent
~~~

~~~
w-100 for taking of the whole 100% space of the  parent's width

form-control : for shape 

mb-1 : margin bottom 
~~~

~~~
Assignment : Do the spacing in such a way that all the rows and cols are evenly separated 
hint justify content
