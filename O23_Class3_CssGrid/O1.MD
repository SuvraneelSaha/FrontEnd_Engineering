### Css Grid

Check 

~~~
Not attempting the assignments 
you have to be responsible for all the learnings your learnings 

But Assignments are the one which will make you jump through the lectures 

in case of frontend there is the best part of actually seeing what is happening in front of you 
so its better than dsa or any other cs subjects as you will get to see the outcome 

So better to do assignments and learn from it 
than to just baang your head in the lecture videos

CSS - beautify the structural html elements 
also 
important is alignments 

rectangles alligned in a certain way
once you start to visualize everything in rectangle and how the rectangles are arranged or styled 

flexbox - arrangement is also easy 

CSS Grid is very important on a scalable basis 


~~~

~~~
CSS Grid takes more mathematical aspects 

CSS grid more complex alignment can be done 
~~~

~~~
Explicit and implicit tracking 

Explicit : columns 3 columns 
we dint given rows 
so it is implicit or automatically calculating 

~~~

~~~
grid track lines or numbers 
the cols and rows lines 
~~~

~~~
in case of many columns 
in case of custom is ok 
but in case of consistent sizing 
then we 
use 
repeat(3,5rem)
~~~
~~~
Slow and steady - 
first we learn the properties in flexbox then 
we can use it in websites 
~~~

~~~
grid-wrapper has 9 items ie child elements 
and all of these are divs 
grid-wrapper > div --> direct children of grid-wrapper of div 

You dont need to wrote learn them 
just know that there exists and back of the mind you have the idea 
You cant learn everything 

How clean you write css is important 

search position algorithm 
need to know in the mind and 
then when implementing just read the docs 

Reading docs is a superpower 


~~~

~~~
There are always excuses 

in frontend the magic is in practicing not learning more and more stuffs 

focus more on the assignments 
you dont need to remember everything you need to practice everything 

Some improvements is better than nothing 

Promotion is not needed what is needed is the skillset and experience 
You have to have indepth knowledge 

Conferences and Open source 
1st job - then go whereever go you get an opportunity 
then once you have the experience 
So as a Fresher you dont have so much choices 
but do upskilling , its the only way 

darna nehi hein aage badhna hein 
Focus karo kaam karo khud ke liye 
aagar daroge toh badoge nehi 
darna nehi hein aage badhna hein
