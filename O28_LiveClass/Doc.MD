How can you be better at designing and making websites with just html and css 

the answer is to build websites 
dont follow a channel or dont watch tutorials on anything 
you when starting need to obviously follow some videos and tutorials but after that phase 
you no longer need to watch any of those things , 

Replace that with coding and building websites . there are plenty of websites to draw inspiration from 
 so better look up in the web for these websites and use html and css to clone them or make as near perfect to the original 
 material . 

and after that just jump straight to javascript , nothing else matters more than javascript . 
do dsa questions with js do everything 
make it your wife . and see how she gives you rewards .
