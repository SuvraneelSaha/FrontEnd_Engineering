Painting is the process of rendering pixels of each element based on their calculations , style and other info 
it involves rendering content backgrounds borders and other visual properties

### Repainting 
~~~
when the elements change ie html elements - thats where repaint happens 
if there is a lot of repainting is done then performance decreases 

For the process of repainting there is a concept of Invalidation :
Browser identifies what elements which will be repainted which will be not 

FOR Senior engineer - repainting time decrease task will be given - ie optimization 

the concept of lazy in CS : 
A work that is not priority then it can be done later 

Repainting :

Do it on Leetcode for understanding 
for google chrome 

cntrl + shift + p --> rendering tab --> paint Flashing 
When ever we write something on the code editor of leetcode repainting happens 

ie more tools 

Frame Rendering Stats : 
when frame rendering drops - ex - when heavy js is working behind and there is maybe a css animation

Ex - where the frame Rendering lags - Irrevalent amount of Repainting and frame drops 

Important - Keep up the space ,Nigga 


Show Layer Borders --> Inside of the rendering tab 
its also a tool 

Confusion between rendering and repainting : 
Rendering - html dom + css om + render tree + layout + painting 

Painting : visual effect changing according to the user interaction
