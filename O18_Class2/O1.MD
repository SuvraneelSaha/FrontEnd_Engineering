## How Browsers work Continuation 

### Painting in Browsers

Painting in Browsers 

Painting is the process of rendering pixels of each element based on their calculations , style and other info 
it involves rendering content backgrounds borders and other visual properties 

~~~

### Repainting 
~~~
when the elements change ie html elements - thats where repaint happens 
if there is a lot of repainting is done then performance decreases 

For the process of repainting there is a concept of Invalidation :
Browser identifies what elements which will be repainted which will be not 

FOR Senior engineer - repainting time decrease task will be given - ie optimization 

the concept of lazy in CS : 
A work that is not priority then it can be done later 

Repainting :

Do it on Leetcode for understanding 
for google chrome 

cntrl + shift + p --> rendering tab --> paint Flashing 
When ever we write something on the code editor of leetcode repainting happens 

ie more tools 

Frame Rendering Stats : 
when frame rendering drops - ex - when heavy js is working behind and there is maybe a css animation

Ex - where the frame Rendering lags - Irrevalent amount of Repainting and frame drops 

Important - Keep up the space ,Nigga 


Show Layer Borders --> Inside of the rendering tab 
its also a tool 

Confusion between rendering and repainting : 
Rendering - html dom + css om + render tree + layout + painting 

Painting : visual effect changing according to the user interaction 

~~~

~~~
For Optimisation Purpose 

Painting - either incremental 
          or global 

incremental - specific part of the webpage 
global - all 

painting order steps 
Background color 
Background image
Border
children css recursively done 
Output

Why do you need DSA in development 

For making Browser Rendering Engine 

DSA is needed cause developers working in mozilla and all they need to create their own web rendering engine 
so - for which DSA is needed 

Following a complex thing is good ; implementing from the complex thing and learning is also good 

also taking explanation from chat gpt is good 
Not taking an advantage is a disadvantage

Viewport Measurements :

vh - viewport height 

vw - viewport width 

100 vw - full width of the browser width
          what you see on the browser 

ie the visible area 

width : 10 vmin ; 
viewport minimum 

vmax - larger dimenstion 
viewport width and viewport height important 

Finish all the modules of css and html and also the assignment 
and do extra projects  
learn extra - from odin 
this above is non negotiable 

position property 

html canvas - using game
