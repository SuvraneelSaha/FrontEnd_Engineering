we have used a label for attribute = gender so for which there will be no bias no selection beforehand 

~~~

~~~
 name att in case of radio box can be selected only once so only 1 value will be returned 

    value determines the value that will be send back to the server 

    here in case of the radiobox only 1 value will be send 

    and as all the 3 input elements have the same name gender - the user have to choose only 1 

    id maybe not be used for each input values 


    the key will be the name attribute and the value will be the given value
