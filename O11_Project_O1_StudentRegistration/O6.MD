its used with td ie table data

We can even make a table inside of a tr inside of a td 
ie 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table>
      </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
~~~


~~~
    <tr>
      <td><input type="submit" value="clickme to submit"></td>
      <td><input type="reset" value="RESET IT"></td>
    </tr>

    these two basically works in form , in case of table it doesnt works 

    submit input type is used to submit the data of the form 

    rest input type is used to reset the values of the form 

    when we wrap a table inside of a form we can insert data , access , update , submit , delete , reset the datas
