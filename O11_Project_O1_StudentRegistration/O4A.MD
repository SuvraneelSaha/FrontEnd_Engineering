## Radio Buttons

~~~
as the 3 input elements have the same name attribute value , so for which we can select any one of them 

this happens in case of radio buttons only , whenever we need to get input of only 1 thing ie single option we use radio buttons 
~~~

~~~
But in case of checkboxes we have select multiple options with different values
~~~

~~~
Also we have used the label in such a way that . Generally the for att in label is given an element's id 
but here we have given the name also the name att is present inside of all the 3 elements so whenever the user will click the label it wont select anything
