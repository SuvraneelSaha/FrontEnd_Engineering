### Why we need to learn Linux

~~~
Well Linux is a great place (OS) to start learning the world computer Science 
also majority of the servers and all the computers have linux OS or some distros of it 

So for deployment to the cloud or to navigate a server it is very important to learn LINUX 
Its free , OpenSource , For all , suites every electronic device like iot based devices like 
Raspberri PI , Arduino , Fridge , Car any electronic device .

### Reason not to fret about the details 

~~~
In the beginning one should not fret about the internalities of a software or anything 
rather than learn the basics cause the internal learnings are a rabit hole and one can get stuck and cant come out . So rather than spending a whole 1 year to learn about linux and everything learn for 1 hour linux and finish the task at hand and when required learn more . 
Period.
