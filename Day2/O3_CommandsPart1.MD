### Commands Part 1 

~~~
pwd : present working directory 

ls: list directory contents
you can print all the files and the sub directories that are 
present inside of the directory 

cd : Change dir 

cd.. : if you want to jump one folder back from the current dir

cd ../.. : if you want to make two jumps back from the current dir

cd ~ : if you want to jump from any dir to home dir

cd dir1/dir2 : we can actually move into internal sub dirs directly by separating them with a forward slash / 


~~~

### Bonus

~~~
if you want to know about a command use 
either 
man command 
Example - man ls 

or use 

ls --help

if you want to open a file then use the command open 

Example - open workbook.pdf 

the default opener for that file will open it 

~~~

> for changing dir that have a larger name 

~~~
Example : You want to cd to Important Pdfs and Documents 

so you have to use 

cd Important\ Pdfs\ and\ Documents/ 

like these 
the forward slash (\) will act as a concatenation of the words 

and the backslash(/) is used for directories and jumping in and out 
~~~

> As for any human being it is not possible to remember all the folders name and we dont even want to write it 
so to minimize the work we use tab keyword which shows us suggestions 

~~~
cd Dow then we pressed tab . It will 
show all the folders starting with Dow
