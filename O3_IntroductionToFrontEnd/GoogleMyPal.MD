1. You wont be able to learn everything on Day1 
You just cannot expect that to learn everything about everything 
ex - Netflix , Gpay , Amazon , Maps 
Every app has each challenges and problems 


2. its totally totally okay not to learn about everything 
its not an jee exam 


3. Google is your best friend 
Ex - Angular js version changes from 
Angular js 1 to angular js 2 

Tech is an industry where if you are not constantly learning you will be finished you will be easily replaced 

so Google is your best friend , learn learn from google . 

3. if your dont use your time to debug issues then you will never become a developer -- 2 hours minimum 
dont expect to become a developer if you dont know the art of googling

Repitation - Rewatch the recordings -- Important 
Do the same project by yourself and build it all by yourself

if no struggle then no life

Learn by doing and by repeated practice 

visually output will make the process of learning so much easier and rewarding .
