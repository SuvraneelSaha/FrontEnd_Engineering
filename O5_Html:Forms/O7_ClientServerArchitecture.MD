## Client Server Architecture

~~~
So what basically is a client server Architecture 
in layman's terms its a way to send information over the internet to a server 
and the server in return sends a meaningful output 

Example - in case of book my show we select a a bunch of items 
like the seat numbers , number of seats , type of seats , movie , timing of the movie 
and we submit it these info will be send to the server via the net using some protocols or rules 

and the server - which maybe a machine or maybe a process running on a machine sends a meaningful outcome 

and here in this case it is a Payment Response . 
Ex - 600 rs per head so 4 people 
2400 rs payment response and the payment portal will be send from the server 

the user which is interating with the bms app is known as the client side 

and the logics and the output that will be generated from the server is known as server side
