## Importance of Name Attribute 

~~~
Used to identify the field of an input or of a form 

Example 
<input type="text" placeholder="name" value="John Doe" name="firstName">

  <input type="text" placeholder="address" value="ABC Nagar" name="address">


  Clearly these two inputs can be differentiated by seeing their name attribute as they portray the 
  field of the data
