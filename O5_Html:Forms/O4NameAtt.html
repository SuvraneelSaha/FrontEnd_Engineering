<!-- Name attribute - 
Name of the element. For example used by the server to identify the fields in form submits. -->

<!-- if if by any chance the user sended false information to that of the firstname and the address 
then the backend people will understand the data for which field it is coming 

for which the name attribute is used to identify the data field in the forms and inputs -->

<!-- the Question Paper and Answer analogy 
whenever we write an answers in an exam we give the question number on the left side 
to specify the answer to the question 
similar in this case the name attribute is used to understand for which field the data is send to the backend  -->
